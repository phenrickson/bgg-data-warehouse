# Cloud Run Service Auth Pattern (reusable)

## Problem

Cloud Run services in this ecosystem are deployed `--allow-unauthenticated` with
`roles/run.invoker` granted to **`allUsers`** — confirmed live for all five
`bgg-predictive-models` services (`bgg-model-scoring`, `bgg-embeddings-service`,
`bgg-collection-scoring`, `bgg-text-embeddings-service`, `bgg-streamlit-prod`). Anyone
who discovers a `.run.app` URL can invoke them: pull proprietary model outputs, burn
compute, and open a public dashboard. We need a gating pattern that (a) lets an
authorized human access a service easily, (b) makes *granting* access a simple,
revocable operation, and (c) applies unchanged to every service so we can extend it to
the predictive-models services.

## Pattern

**Gate — Cloud Run IAM.** Deploy every gated service `--no-allow-unauthenticated` and
ensure `allUsers` is **not** in its IAM policy. The service is then invocable only by
identities holding `roles/run.invoker` on it.

**Grant surface — one invoker Google Group.** Create a single group, e.g.
`bgg-api-invokers@googlegroups.com` (or a Cloud Identity group), and grant it
`roles/run.invoker` on each gated service **once**. Thereafter "provide access" is a
group-membership change, never a per-service IAM edit:

- Authorized **person** → add `user:someone@example.com` to the group.
- **Service** caller (the dash-viewer runtime SA; later, predictive-models callers) →
  add `serviceAccount:…@….iam.gserviceaccount.com` to the group. (Google Groups accept
  service accounts as members.)
- **Revoke** → remove the member.

Per-service `add-iam-policy-binding` of an individual member is the fallback when a
group isn't set up yet — but the group is what makes "I can provide access" a one-step
operation, so prefer it.

**Human access (easy).** Either:

- Ad-hoc: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" <url>/health`
- Local dev (nicest): `gcloud run services proxy bgg-warehouse-api --region us-central1`
  then hit `http://localhost:8080` — the proxy injects your identity, no header needed.

**Service-to-service access.** The caller mints a Google-signed **ID token** whose
audience is the target service URL and attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer`. Reusable
helper (copy into each caller repo; ~15 lines, no new heavy deps — `google-auth` is
already present):

```python
import google.auth.transport.requests
import google.oauth2.id_token

def id_token_headers(audience_url: str) -> dict:
    """Bearer header for calling an authenticated Cloud Run service.

    Works off ADC: the Cloud Run metadata server in prod, a service-account context
    locally. `audience_url` is the target service's base URL.
    """
    req = google.auth.transport.requests.Request()
    token = google.oauth2.id_token.fetch_id_token(req, audience_url)
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
```

The callee needs **no application code** to verify the token — Cloud Run IAM validates
it at the edge before the request reaches the app.

## Applying it here (warehouse read API)

1. Deploy `bgg-warehouse-api` `--no-allow-unauthenticated`.
2. Grant the invoker group `roles/run.invoker` on it (or, day one, bind your own
   `user:` and the dash-viewer `serviceAccount:` directly).
3. The dash-viewer consumer (follow-up PR) builds its `requests` calls with
   `id_token_headers(WAREHOUSE_API_URL)`.

## Extending to the predictive-models services (follow-up)

The same three moves per service, one service at a time to avoid breakage:

1. Identify every current caller of the service (scoring pipeline, Streamlit, dash-viewer)
   and confirm each can mint an ID token (runs as a service account).
2. Add each caller's identity to the invoker group; grant the group `run.invoker` on the
   service.
3. Redeploy the service `--no-allow-unauthenticated`, remove `allUsers`, and update each
   caller to attach `id_token_headers(url)`.

**Special case — `bgg-streamlit-prod`:** it's a *browser-facing* dashboard, so
ID-token/`run.invoker` gating doesn't apply (browsers don't send ID tokens). That one
needs **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** or in-app login, and is a separate decision from
the machine-to-machine services.

## What this doesn't change

- No change to how services authenticate to BigQuery/GCS (still ADC / runtime SA).
- The pattern gates *inbound* invocation only.
- Remediating the existing `allUsers` exposure is tracked as its own security follow-up
  (see the plan) — this spec defines the target pattern, it does not itself flip the
  live services.
